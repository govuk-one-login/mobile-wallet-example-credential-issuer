# mobile-wallet-example-credential-issuer

## Overview
A credential Issuer following the [OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance v1.0; pre-authorized code flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#name-pre-authorized-code-flow) to issue credentials into the GOV.UK wallet.

## Pre-requisites

### SDKMan
This project has an `.sdkmanrc` file.

Install SDKMan via the instructions on `https://sdkman.io/install`.

For auto-switching between JDK versions, edit your `~/.sdkman/etc/config` and set `sdkman_auto_env=true`.

Then use sdkman to install Java JDK listed in this project's `.sdkmanrc`, e.g. `sdk install java x.y.z-amzn`.

Restart your terminal.

### Gradle
Gradle 8 is used on this project.

## Quickstart

### Linting

Check with `./gradlew spotlessCheck`

Apply with `./gradlew spotlessApply`

### Build
Build with `./gradlew`

By default, this also calls `clean`,  `spotlessApply` and `test`.

### Running Locally

#### Setting up the AWS CLI
You will need to have the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) installed and configured to interact with the local database. You can configure the CLI with the values below by running `aws configure`:
```
AWS Access Key ID [None]: na
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: na
Default region name [None]: eu-west-2
Default output format [None]:
```

#### Setting up LocalStack
This app uses LocalStack to run AWS services locally on port `4560`.

To start the LocalStack container and provision a local version of KMS and the DynamoDB table where credential offers are stored, run `docker compose up`.

You will need to have Docker Desktop or alternative like installed.

#### Running the Application
Run the application with `./gradlew run`

#### Test API Request
To get a credential offer:
```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/credential_offer?walletSubjectId=urn:fdc:wallet.account.gov.uk:2024:DtPT8x-dp_73tnlY3KNTiCitziN9GEherD16bqxNt9i&documentId=testDocumentId&credentialType=BasicCheckCredential | jq
```

To get the credential metadata:
```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer | jq
```

To get a credential (replace the proof JWT and bearer access token values before testing):
```
curl -d '{"proof":{"proof_type":"jwt", "jwt": "<<insert proof jwt>>" }}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <<insert bearer token jwt>>" -X POST http://localhost:8080/credential | jq
```

To get the DID document:
```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/.well-known/did.json | jq
```

To get the JWKS:
```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/.well-known/jwks.json | jq
```

#### Reading from the local Database
To check that a credential offer was saved to the table, run:

`aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4560 --region eu-west-2 dynamodb query --table-name credential_offer_cache --key-condition-expression "credentialIdentifier = :credentialIdentifier" --expression-attribute-values "{ \":credentialIdentifier\" : { \"S\" : \"e457f329-923c-4eb6-85ca-ee7e04b3e173\" } }"`

replacing the **credentialIdentifier** with the relevant one.

To return all items from the table, run:

`aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4560 --region eu-west-2 dynamodb scan --table-name credential_offer_cache`.

### Test
#### Unit Tests
Run unit tests with `./gradlew test`

#### Testing with the Example CRI Test Harness
When testing with the [test harness](https://github.com/govuk-one-login/mobile-wallet-cri-test-harness) locally, you must point the authorization server to the right address:
```
ONE_LOGIN_AUTH_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001 ./gradlew run  
```

## Deploy a stack in dev

> For the following it is required to have a containerisation service (e.g. Docker Desktop) running and to be logged
> into the Mobile Platform dev AWS account

Run the script to build and push the Document Builder docker image, specifying your desired tag and the name of your AWS profile
for the Mobile Platform dev AWS account (which can be found in your `~/.aws/credentials` file):

```shell
./build-and-deploy-image.sh <your-tag-name> <your-mobile-platform-dev-profile> 
```

This will build the docker image, log into ECR, push the image to ECR, and update the `template.yaml` to specify this
image for the Document Builder ECS task.

If using your own deployed version of the doc-builder the following mapping values in the template need to be updated:

```yaml
Mappings:
  EnvironmentVariables:
    dev:
      ...
      CredentialStoreUrl: "<stack-name->stub-credential-issuer.mobile.dev.account.gov.uk"
      AuthServerUrl: "<stack-name->stub-credential-issuer.mobile.dev.account.gov.uk"
```

You can then build the template and deploy the stack:

```bash
sam build && sam deploy --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --stack-name <your_stack_name>
```
